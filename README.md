# Game Of Life

The Game of Life, also known as Conway's Game of Life or simply Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.ðŸ¤“

I was inspired by Bongo Cat(desktop companion) and tried to make Conway's Game Of Life with UI, so it can be runned in background.
